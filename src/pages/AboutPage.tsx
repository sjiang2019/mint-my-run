          <strong>MintMyRun</strong> is a passion project. It has no roadmap,
          airdrop, or utility. It was born simply out of a desire to memorialize
          athletic achievements on the blockchain.

          on the total supply of MintMyRun (MMR) tokens.

        <Typography variant="body1" fontFamily="monospace" paddingTop={2}>
